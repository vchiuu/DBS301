-- Q1 SOLUTION -- 
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, SUBSTR(LAST_NAME || ', '|| FIRST_NAME,0,25) "Full Name", JOB_ID,
    '[' || TRIM(TO_CHAR(HIRE_DATE, 'Month')) || ' '|| 
    TO_CHAR(LAST_DAY(HIRE_DATE), 'fmddth "of" YYYY') || ']' "Start Date"

-- Question 2 - List the employee number, full name, job, and the 
-- modified salary for all employees whose monthly earning (without
-- this increase) is outside the range $5,000 - $10,000 and who are
-- employed as Vice Presidents or Managers (President is not counted)
-- Q2 SOLUTION --

    LAST_NAME || ' who is ' || JOB_ID || ' will have a new salary of $' ||
        CASE

-- IT and SALES as well.
-- Q4 SOLUTION --
SELECT E.DEPARTMENT_ID, E.JOB_ID, MIN(E.SALARY) "Lowest Dept/Job Pay"
FROM EMPLOYEES E JOIN DEPARTMENTS D ON (E.DEPARTMENT_ID = D.DEPARTMENT_ID)

-- department number for each employee who earns less than the best paid
-- unionized employee (i.e. not the president nor any manager nor any VP),
-- who work in either SALES or MARKETING department
-- Q7 SOLUTION --

-- Question 8 - "Tricky One" Display department name, city and number of
-- different jobs in each department. If city is null, you should print
